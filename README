These files are boilerplate class templates for use with the API provided by the Migrate module that is contributed to the Drupal project:
https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate.  The Extended class is meant to extend the Base class.

There are two php class files with placeholder names.  There are also two text files that contain VTL templates that can be setup as file
templates in the phpStorm IDE.  In Settings >> IDE Settings >> File and Code Templates add a template on the templates tab and paste the
contents of the file into the text area.  Give the template an appropriate name and extension and click [Apply]

If you use Dash (http://kapeli.com/dash) or some other snippet manager you may find it helpful to setup these snippets:

$this->addFieldMapping('__destination-field__','__source-field__');

->sourceMigration(array('__MigrationName__'))

$databases['__key__']['default'] = array(
   'driver' => 'mysql',
   'database' => '__databasename__',
   'username' => 'drupal',
   'password' => '__password__',
   'host' => 'localhost',
   'port' => __port__,
   'prefix' => '__myprefix__',
   'collation' => 'utf8_general_ci',
 );
